Chat

The idea is to have a chatroom whose code everyone can edit live both locally and globally, 
they can also send themes to friends and create a catalogue of themes.

One of the main ideas is to have animations, voice cloned TTS and multiple bots at once in the ecosystem.

We can make wiki pages made out of chat messages, in realtime and refine the content as per the nature of discussion.
